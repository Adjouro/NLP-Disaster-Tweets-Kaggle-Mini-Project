# NLP-Disaster-Tweets-Kaggle-Mini-Project
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

We are predicting whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.
